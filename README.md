# Proof of Concept for [Dog Trainer App] 
This document proposes an application for Android OS to instruct users on dog training techniques and periodic reminders to interact with their dog for training. When a person makes a profile on the app, they have the option to enter information on their pet to help cater the training. Following a model of habit-based coaching, the first few weeks of interactions with the app will teach the user to perform simpler training tasks, instructions and encouragement before allowing the user to advance training to complex tasks. The app will track progress on user responses (did the dog obey on a scale of 1-5, were treats correctly used, was training performed on routine, etc). The user will be able to review training progress and past information/tips given by the app in a journal-like format.
